# Decision Tree Classifier for Bank Marketing

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of an internship at **Skillcraft Technologies**. The goal is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a banking product based on demographic and behavioral data using a decision tree classifier.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. The dataset contains various features, including:

- **Demographic Information**: Age, job, marital status, education level, etc.
- **Behavioral Data**: Contact information, previous campaign results, etc.

**Target Variable**: Whether the customer subscribed to a product (yes/no).

## Objective

The objective of this project is to help banks optimize marketing efforts by accurately predicting customer subscriptions, reducing costs, and increasing campaign efficiency.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Train a decision tree classifier on the data.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance.
4. **Prediction**: Make predictions on unseen customer data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.
